[00:02.90]If I bleed tonight
[00:05.40]If I am sad tonight
[00:08.20]I don't have a job to find
[00:11.65]And if I work tonight
[00:14.60]If I'm so tired tonight
[00:17.67]I'll fall asleep when I'm home
[00:21.10]When I'm home
[00:23.78]♫
[00:42.30]I was just so far from here
[00:44.62]Focused on my own way
[00:47.05]Without never looking back
[00:48.90]To those who lived in fear
[00:51.88]There was nothing I could do
[00:53.54]There was nothing you said
[00:56.20]That could make me realize
[00:58.38]How much lucky I was
[01:00.46]Just out of reach of this fire
[01:02.63]I was not aware of this nightmare
[01:05.02]But when I start to see those eyes
[01:06.94]Begging for help and begging for hope
[01:10.10]I just need to open my eyes now
[01:11.90]To try to change and to search how
[01:13.39]To be someone among others
[01:14.95]I've got to try
[01:18.30]If I bleed tonight
[01:20.50]If I am sad tonight
[01:23.20]I don't have a job to find
[01:26.92]And if I work tonight
[01:29.51]If I'm so tired tonight
[01:32.24]I'll fall asleep when I'm home
[01:36.01]When I'm home
[01:38.41]There's no name to call
[01:40.07]The ones that can't see
[01:42.38]The light that shines
[01:44.87]Above their lives
[01:47.71]I can't say my life is crap
[01:49.94]I have to see them too
[01:51.94]I just lived into my world
[01:53.77]Far from the pain they feel
[01:55.56]Just out of reach of this fire
[01:57.62]I was not aware of this nightmare
[01:59.83]But when I start to see those eyes
[02:02.05]Begging for help and begging for hope
[02:04.69]I just need to open my eyes now
[02:06.92]To try to change and to search how
[02:09.38]To be someone among others
[02:11.35]I've got to try
[02:13.20]If I bleed tonight
[02:15.75]If I am sad tonight
[02:18.74]I don't have a job to find
[02:22.50]And if I work tonight
[02:25.14]If I'm so tired tonight
[02:28.12]I'll fall asleep when I'm home
[02:31.45]I was so wrong
[02:33.67]I was so blind
[02:36.06]I was so dumb and out of time
[02:40.75]I was so wrong
[02:43.06]I was so blind
[02:48.47]I was so blind
[03:13.27]If I bleed tonight
[03:14.50]If I am sad tonight
[03:17.57]I don't have a job to find
[03:21.25]And if I work tonight
[03:23.80]If I'm so tired tonight
[03:26.96]I'll fall asleep when I'm home
[03:31.50]When I'm home
[03:36.50]When I'm home
[03:40.90]When I'm home
[03:46.10]When I'm home
