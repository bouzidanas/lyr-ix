[00:35.31]Don't you know that I run this place?
[00:39.36]And I've begun this race, must I rerun this pace?
[00:42.31]I'm the reason its become this way and their love for it
[00:45.62]Is the reason I have become this praised
[00:48.12]They love my darkness, I've made them heartless
[00:51.64]And in return they have become my martyrs
[00:54.45]I've been in the poem of many a poet
[00:56.90]And I reside in the art of many a artist
[01:00.12]Some of your smartest have tried to artictulate
[01:02.70]My whole part in this but they're fruitless in their harvest
[01:05.61]The dro grows from my footsteps, I'm the one
[01:08.36]That they follow, I am the one that they march with
[01:11.79]Through the back alleys and the black markets
[01:14.22]The Oval Offices, the crackhouses and apartments
[01:18.28]Through the mazes of the queens, the pages
[01:20.51]Of the sages and the Chambers of The Kings
[01:23.99]Through the veins-es of the fiends,
[01:25.67]A paper chaser's pager, yo, I'm famous on the scene
[01:28.91]One of the oldest, most ancient-est of things
[01:31.21]Speak every single language on the planet, y'all mean?
[01:35.17]I am the American dream
[01:37.16]The rape of Africa, the undying machine
[01:40.10]The overpriced medicine, the murderous regime
[01:42.97]The tough guy's front and the one behind the scenes
[01:46.90]I am the blood of this city, its gas, water
[01:49.56]And electricity, I'm it's gym, and it's math
[01:52.10]And it's history, the gunshots in the class
[01:55.45]And you can't pass if you're missing, G
[01:58.32]I taught them better than that, I taught them
[02:00.31]Aim for the head and hope they never come back
[02:02.69]I'm glad your daddy's gone, baby
[02:04.28]Hope he never comes back, I hope he's with
[02:06.25]Your mother with my hustlers high in my traps
[02:09.86]I hope you die in this trash, I can't help it
[02:12.22]All you hear when your crying is laughs
[02:14.91]I'm sure somebody'll find you tied up in this bag
[02:17.05]Behind the hospital little baby, crack addicts had
[02:19.97]Then maybe you can grow up to be a stripper
[02:22.45]A welfare-receiving prostitute and gold digger
[02:25.07]You can watch on TV how they should
[02:26.92]Properly depict you, the rivers should flow
[02:28.93]With liqours, quench your thirst on my elixers
[02:30.81]I am the safe haven for the rebel runaway and the resistor
[02:34.64]The trusted misleader, the number one defender
[02:37.92]And from a throne of their bones I rule
[02:40.44]These fools are my fuel so I make them cool
[02:43.11]Baptize them in the water out of Scarface pool
[02:45.84]And feed them from the table that held Corleone's food
[02:49.15]If you die, tell them that you played my game
[02:51.60]I hope your bulletholes become mouths
[02:53.33]That say my name 'cause I'm the...
