[01:09.15]We're all chemicals, vitamins and minerals
[01:11.55]And Vicodin with inner tubes, wrapped around the arm
[01:14.78]To see the vein like a chicken on the barn
[01:17.44]Top Cat chat, let's begin another yarn
[01:20.14]That's flying saucer cheese, or is it chicken parm?
[01:23.03]But roosters don't fly like boosters don't buy
[01:25.80]So what powers cowards to get them to the top?
[01:28.84]Just to fall asleep listening to Bach
[01:31.61]The ribbon in the sky is the ribbon that I drop
[01:34.52]Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock
[01:37.30]That lacks meaning but racks up stacks of fat reading
[01:40.18]They catch chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings
[01:44.08]Now what's a coffin with a scratched ceiling?
[01:47.01]And what's the talking without the match feeling
[01:49.03]As buried living and cherry picking every lemon
[01:51.62]From your berry system then proceed with the pack feeding
[01:54.79]When I was young, I had visions of another world
[01:57.41]Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother Hurl
[02:00.38]Incense smoke made vortices and other curls
[02:03.07]Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls
[02:07.02]I like my pancakes cut in swirls
[02:09.74]Morrocan moles and undercover squirrels
[02:11.93]I like cartoons, southern cities with large moons
[02:14.52]Faith healers, ex-female drug dealers and art booms
[02:18.33]Apologize for my weird mix
[02:20.73]What taste like hot dogs and tear drips
[02:23.61]And looks like pantomime and clear bricks
[02:26.43]And smells like shotguns and deer piss
[02:28.97]They on their hunt, kind of salty that I'm going hard
[02:31.80]First part of a party, that I throw in parts
[02:34.53]One minute you playing pool, next minute you throwing darts
[02:37.41]But that's how you do with a party that you throw in bars
[02:41.27]I run the Gambit like I'm throwing cards
[02:43.68]From popular mechanics to overdosing hearts
[02:46.06]Paint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes
[02:48.83]Nerd game make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake
[02:51.59]A word game back up plan that can dam lakes
[02:54.56]Backup the word play playing at the man's states
[02:57.39]Means I can still be the man if the dam breaks
[03:00.15]And when demand brakes, some reflections what they can't face
[03:03.00]My peers will still treat the mirror, like it's a fan base
[03:05.87]The unfettered veteran, the eagle feathered man of medicine
[03:09.22]That hovers above cities like weathermen
[03:11.55]And maybe weather women
[03:12.84]Whatever better to tell your weather coming
[03:14.66]I prefer girls to reign all over the world
[03:17.21]And not rain like, rain man or like rain dance
[03:20.17]Or rain like a slight chance of rain when it's raining
[03:22.96]Or rein like deer slaves, the Santa Claus sleigh man
[03:25.96]But reign like queens that reign over made man
[03:29.01]And not queen like "Queen Killer", "Rhapsody Bohemian" Queen
[03:31.92]But Queen like white glove wave hand
[03:34.57]And not wave hand like it's a heat wave
[03:36.70]So you make a fan by waving your hand
[03:38.73]I'm talking wave like you saying "hey, man"
[03:41.73]And not hay for horses and horses like you almost voiceless
[03:44.63]You got to treat your vocal chords like it's a fortress
[03:46.80]And treat every single one of your words like reinforcements and
[03:49.49]Especially when you're recording cause that's the portion that's important
[03:51.95]When I was reporting that I was poor, but now I'm more than
[03:55.12]It's still hooker heels on my sugar hills and sweet spots
[03:58.20]Crying shames, make margarita rims from cheap tops
[04:01.01]Deep plots in floor to ceiling windows for my peep pots
[04:03.77]A little scene with the sickle swings to make the wheat drop
[04:06.45]In a hundred words, but them humming birds like to ease drop
[04:09.41]And fan out like peacocks with a parakeet that beat box
[04:12.11]So the sun rise when the beat drops and the sun dies when the beat stops
[04:16.46]Then it unties, then it relocks
[04:17.88]Then it relapse, then it detox then heat back like a heat pack
[04:20.69]On his knee caps of the weak spot cause he want what we got
[04:23.54]Like yeah, yeah, uh
[04:35.48]Then forge poetry like a young ornery Morrissey
[04:37.86]Then spit it to the golden lock thots who like their porridge all watery
[04:41.43]Not scorching nor sorbity from the steel orbitings
[04:43.76]Sorcerer, sorcery, coming down gorgeously
[04:47.63]Just like a Stacey Dash waterfall
[04:49.88]A more torturing, a water boarding Barbie doll
[04:52.62]A river of women like a Brazilian carnival
[04:55.21]Swimming in feminine bikinis made out of Barbasol
[04:59.07]Somebody give them the volleyballs
[05:01.27]If you love her, don't ever send her to Mally Mall's
[05:03.89]Homie if she lonely she might end up in Macauly's claws
[05:06.59]Coming out the closet over goblets down at Madri Gras
[05:09.76]The fame, champagne, walk of shame lobby call
[05:12.59]My reposition was black condition of activism
[05:15.28]Ammunition for abolition missions attacking systems
[05:18.10]But they not after listens unless it's dropping on Activision
[05:21.33]Are we apps or are we bodies filled with apparitions?
[05:23.90]Operating applications, stuck inside a apple prison
[05:26.63]Check and hacking downloads, updates that lack religion
[05:29.43]Or, are we more?
[05:32.52]Than soil painting, disloyal changlings preoccupied
[05:35.04]With boy and girl chasing and foiling other's royal saintings
[05:38.07]I sit back and watch the world through the eye holes in my oil paintings
[05:40.93]Uh, ain't nothing to it but to do it
[05:43.68]Unless you Virgin Mary nothing do it but the truest
[05:46.63]Believe all that unless you Jewish
[05:49.53]Life is not a dictionary, it's a thesaurus
[05:52.27]And I feel like a missionary to a clitoris
[05:55.15]The water bearer heir of traditions that I swear
[05:57.68]To never change my chair position or conditions of my porridge
[06:00.85]Submission for sedition against the religion of a chorus
[06:03.45]Keep them golden weave thieves out the motherfucking forest
[06:07.31]As I perform a nerve storm, I prefer my pictures in word form
[06:11.47]Bury the hatchet like how a bird born as I paint cold pictures
[06:15.23]Like Kool-Aid facing condensation having conversations
[06:18.03]With flavourful combinations, slave to my concentration
[06:21.16]So that's OJ da Juiceman meets OJ with two hands
[06:24.04]And two gloves that's too snug to judge who was, who drew blood
[06:27.21]And, Lupe look at all these toucans
[06:31.03]In a cemetery full of tomahawkes
[06:33.18]Giving middle fingers to the pigeons doing somersaults
[06:35.97]Road runners don't fall off cliffs, they run across
[06:38.71]Anomalies by the colonies flukes by the reservoir
[06:41.61]Wilding pursuers end up as poofs on the desert floor
[06:44.62]Levitating youth so know the truth of where the fountain hides
[06:47.39]Bucaraa Roof painting tunnels onto the mountain side
[06:50.79]A thousands parts a pound of heart an ounce of eyes
[06:53.00]Announcing now the doubt in mouth pronounces a count of lies
[06:56.80]Chocula Counts by the counts of five
[06:58.74]Refrigerator roof full of animals and monsters
[07:01.40]Incinerated chutes and the manual for Contra
[07:05.06]Assorted memories from my childhood
[07:07.92]Absorbing energy from the wild woods
[07:10.23]Electronic combat Konami sign contract
[07:13.09]Chinese char killing cucarachas on contact
[07:16.43]Chicago spray gun aficionado
[07:18.62]Efficient spitting bridging divisions is in Chicano
[07:21.65]Who's the boss if isn't Alyssa Milano?
[07:24.48]Dudikoff, ninja mission into the Congo
[07:27.31]Polarize envy of the older guys, black obi shinobi
[07:30.55]Hitting Kenno in the face with all my throwing knives
[07:33.06]Subzero guiding, hiding, riding in the pack as well
[07:35.96]Sound village, leaf village, wolf spirit, magic spells
[07:38.72]Yeah, uh, dodging rain and catching hail
[07:42.01]Faces need samurais to catch the L
[07:44.66]Special research vessels made for catching whales
[07:47.23]Filet-O-Fish ships sea-shepherded peppered with extra sails
[07:50.50]Rewrite history, liberty needs a better bell
[07:53.08]Maybe how the ions in carbon fibres that never fail
[07:55.88]Smart as science mixed with odd alliance of fairytale
[07:59.01]Or maybe just a metal pail that you hit with a steel tools
[08:01.70]To announce that you've had enough and dropping out of SEAL school
[08:04.43]Just like trout jumping out they house to let they gills cool
[08:07.28]Cuba-scuba couldn't take the temperature of my skill pool
[08:10.13]Yeah, said it feels cool to kill fools
[08:13.34]Slipping through the cracks like when you trying to grill gruel
[08:15.96]Take no Viking water bottle and not following pill rules
[08:18.70]Will have you off of the throttle when you should be modeling chill mood
[08:21.71]Rollerskate maker or are you just cobbling wheel shoes
[08:24.58]Overweight taster of kings food that kills crews
[08:27.46]Oblivious feather-weight baker who autographed
[08:30.12]Cakes whenever his quill moves over your meal
[08:32.61]You simple as a Buddhist monk in a temple
[08:35.22]Standing in some heel grooves with the abbot, practicing stillness
[08:39.10]Real still til he realizes his realness
[08:41.49]Defeat Samsara achieves nirvana and brilliance, yeah
